# midi-compozer

This is an old music composition program for DOS.

It was written in the early->mid 90's (before the prevalance of modern 32-bit operating systems). It was a fun exercise to learn
how to interact with hardware on x86 platform, including installing ISRs (for keyboard handling and timer callbacks) and working
with EMS (an old-school API for accessing more than 640kb of memory from 16-bit code).

I actually still use this software today -- though under Windows 7, using DOSBox.

BTW, the code is heinous, I know. I wrote it while I was still in school. (That's the only excuse I can offer...)
